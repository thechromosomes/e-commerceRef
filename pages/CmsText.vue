                <h5>Buckles on shoes or belts</h5>
                <p>
                  Use an old toothbrush and toothpaste. Then wipe off with a
                  damp rag or rinse under cold water.
                </p>

                <h5>Cowhide, calfskin, kidskin</h5>
                <p>
                  Keep well-polished. Polishing keeps shoes looking good, as
                  well as keeping leather soft. As a preventative measure, it's
                  advisable to apply several coats of transparent polish before
                  shoes are worn for the first time
                </p>
                <h5>Fabric shoes</h5>
                <p>
                  Wash some fabric shoes by hand and let air dry at least once a
                  month to keep them looking new. Keep the shape by stuffing
                  with newspaper and replace as it gets soaked through.
                  Newspaper helps speed up the drying process.
                </p>

                <h5>Nubuck</h5>
                <p>
                  Wipe with cloth or use soft brush to remove surface dirt.
                </p>
                <h5>Patent leather</h5>
                <p>
                  Remove surface soil with damp cloth. Occasionally apply soft
                  cream polish or thin film of Vaseline petroleum jelly. To keep
                  leather flexible, apply conditioner or preservative. For good
                  results, clean patent leather with Windex.
                </p>
                <h5>Reptile (alligator, lizard, crocodile, snake)</h5>
                <p>
                  Snakeskin should only be polished with a soft cloth that is
                  wiped with the grain. Spraying lightly with hairspray will
                  help to keep the grain down.
                </p>
                <h5>Satin</h5>
                <p>
                  Regular trips to the dry cleaners will keep them looking new.
                </p>
                <h5>Suede shoes</h5>
                <p>
                  Should be brushed clean with a suede brush or light sand
                  paper. This will raise the nap of the leather as well as
                  loosen dirt. Never use water on suede because the dissolved
                  minerals usually cause spotting. Stains such as paint or glue
                  can be removed with fine sandpaper. A gum eraser or soft side
                  of an emery board helps remove spots.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>FUN TIP</strong> - If your leather laces always come
                  undone, keep them tied by sprinkling a few drops of water on
                  the knot.
